# Welcome to WellBee
This is currently just a readme to contain notes on how I'm making the app, I'll turn it into a cohesive guide later.

## How it work?
We're using a RaspberryPi 4 running apache2, mysql and php to host the webapp and database(Used [this guide](https://www.instructables.com/Installing-LAMP-Linux-Apache-MySQL-PHP-on-a-Raspbe/) to help me set it up ). I also installed phpmyadmin to make editing databases easier.
